The bill establishes a private right of action for Freedmen.</p> <p>The bill directs the Government Accountability Office to issue an annual report on the tribe's expenditure of federal funds and whether the tribe is in full compliance with all federal laws related to the management and disbursement of such funds.</p>]]>
