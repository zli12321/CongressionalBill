          <![CDATA[ <p><strong>Small Business Tax Relief Act</strong></p> <p>This bill establishes a graduated corporate tax rate for corporations whose taxable income does not exceed $5 million. The rate of such tax is 18% of taxable income not exceeding $400,000, and 21% of taxable income that equals or exceeds $400,000. </p> <p>The bill also modifies the tax treatment of carried interest, which is compensation that is typically received by a partner of a private equity or hedge fund and is based on a share of the fund's profits. (Under current law, carried interest is taxed as investment income rather than at ordinary income tax rates.)</p> <p>The bill includes provisions that </p> <ul> <li>set forth a special rule for the inclusion in gross income of partnership interests transferred in connection with the performance of services,</li> <li> treat as ordinary income the net capital gain with respect to an investment services partnership interest except to the extent such gain is attributable to a partner's qualified capital interest, </li> <li> exempt income from investment services partnership interests from treatment as qualifying income of a publicly traded partnership, </li> <li> exempt certain family partnerships from the application of this bill, </li> <li> increase the penalty for underpayments of tax resulting from failure to treat income from an investment services partnership interest as ordinary income, and</li> <li> include income and loss from an investment services partnership interest for purposes of determining net earnings from self-employment and applicable self-employment taxes.</li> </ul> <p>The bill defines <i>investment services partnership interest</i> as any interest in a partnership held by a person who provides services to a partnership by (1) advising the partnership about investing in, purchasing, or selling specified assets; (2) managing, acquiring, or disposing of specified assets; or (3) arranging financing with respect to acquiring specified assets.</p>]]>
