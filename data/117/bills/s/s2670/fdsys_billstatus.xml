          <![CDATA[ <p><b>Redistricting Reform Act of </b><strong>2021</strong></p> <p>This bill sets forth requirements for congressional redistricting.</p> <p>Specifically, the bill requires that congressional redistricting be conducted in accordance&nbsp;with a plan developed by (1) a state-established independent commission; or (2) if such a commission does not enact a plan, a three-judge panel from a U.S. District Court. This requirement does not apply to a state that has a plan developed and approved by an independent redistricting commission that complies with specified requirements.</p> <p>The bill outlines the criteria for a redistricting plan, including that the plan shall not unduly favor or disfavor any political party.</p> <p>Further, the bill establishes the requirements for appointing members to a state-established independent redistricting commission, including diversity requirements. The Government Accountability Office must report on the extent to which these commissions meet the diversity requirements.</p> <p>Next, the bill prohibits a state where the congressional districts have been redistricted from carrying out another redistricting until after the next apportionment of Representatives following a decennial census, unless a court requires the state to conduct a subsequent redistricting to comply with the Constitution, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, or the provisions of the bill.</p> <p>The bill also directs the Election Assistance Commission to make payments to states to carry out congressional redistricting.</p>]]>
