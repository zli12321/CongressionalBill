          <![CDATA[ <p><strong>PFAS Exposure Assessment and Documentation Act</strong></p> <p>This bill requires the Department of Defense (DOD) to include in various health evaluations an assessment of whether a member of the Armed Forces has been exposed to perfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroalkyl substances, commonly referred to as PFAS. In addition, DOD must establish a task force to address the effects of the release of PFAS from DOD activities.</p> <p>The bill requires DOD to ensure that any periodic health assessment, physical assessment for recently separated members, pre-deployment medical examination, post-deployment medical examination, and post-deployment health reassessment provided to a member of the Armed Forces includes an evaluation of whether the member has been exposed to PFAS or was based or stationed at a military installation with a known or suspected release of PFAS during the period the member was there.</p> <p>If any of the evaluations result in a positive determination of potential exposure to PFAS, DOD must provide blood testing during the evaluation. </p> <p>DOD must pay for blood testing to determine and document potential exposure to PFAS for former members of the Armed Forces or family members of such members who lived at a location identified by DOD as having a known or suspected PFAS release during the individuals' residency.</p> <p>DOD must share results of the evaluations with the Department of Veterans Affairs and establish a registry of members of the Armed Forces who have been exposed to, or are suspected to have been exposed to, PFAS. Members may elect to be excluded from the registry.</p>]]>
